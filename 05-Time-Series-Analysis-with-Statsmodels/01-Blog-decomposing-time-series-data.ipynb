    "## [How to Decompose Time Series Data into Trend and Seasonality](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series decomposition involves thinking of a series as a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposition provides a useful abstract model for thinking about time series generally and for better understanding problems during time series analysis and forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover time series decomposition and how to automatically split a time series into its components with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time series decomposition method of analysis and how it can help with forecasting.\n",
    "- How to automatically decompose time series data in Python.\n",
    "- How to decompose additive and multiplicative time series problems and plot the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Components\n",
    "A useful abstraction for selecting forecasting methods is to break a time series down into systematic and unsystematic components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Systematic__: Components of the time series that have consistency or recurrence and can be described and modeled.\n",
    "- __Non-Systematic__: Components of the time series that cannot be directly modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### systematic and non-systematic components\n",
    "\n",
    "A given time series is thought to consist of three systematic components including level, trend, seasonality, and one non-systematic component called noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Level__: The average value in the series.\n",
    "- __Trend__: The increasing or decreasing value in the series.\n",
    "- __Seasonality__: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.\n",
    "- __Noise__: The random variation in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Time Series Components\n",
    "\n",
    "A series is thought to be an aggregate or combination of these four components.\n",
    "\n",
    "All series have a level and noise. The trend and seasonality components are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to think of the components as combining either additively or multiplicatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additive Model\n",
    "\n",
    "An additive model suggests that the components are added together as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An additive model is linear where changes over time are consistently made by the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear trend is a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear seasonality has the same frequency (width of cycles) and amplitude (height of cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplicative Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiplicative model suggests that the components are multiplied together as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y(t) = Level * Trend * Seasonality * Noise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiplicative model is nonlinear, such as quadratic or exponential. Changes increase or decrease over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nonlinear trend is a curved line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-linear seasonality has an increasing or decreasing frequency and/or amplitude over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition as a Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a useful abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposition is primarily used for time series analysis, and as an analysis tool it can be used to inform forecasting models on your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a structured way of thinking about a time series forecasting problem, both generally in terms of modeling complexity and specifically in terms of how to best capture each of these components in a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these components are something you may need to think about and address during data preparation, model selection, and model tuning. You may address it explicitly in terms of modeling the trend and subtracting it from your data, or implicitly by providing enough history for an algorithm to model a trend if it may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may or may not be able to cleanly or perfectly break down your specific time series as an additive or multiplicative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world problems are messy and noisy. There may be additive and multiplicative components. There may be an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend. There may be non-repeating cycles mixed in with the repeating seasonality components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, these abstract models provide a simple framework that you can use to analyze your data and explore ways to think about and forecast your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Time Series Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "There are methods to [automatically decompose](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/3) a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statsmodels library provides an implementation of the naive, or classical, decomposition method in a function called [seasonal_decompose()](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html). It requires that you specify whether the model is __additive or multiplicative__.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Both will produce a result and you must be careful to be critical when interpreting the result. A review of a plot of the time series and some summary statistics can often be a good start to get an idea of whether your time series problem looks additive or multiplicative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The _seasonal_decompose()_ function returns a result object. The result object contains arrays to access four pieces of data from the decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the snippet below shows how to decompose a series into trend, seasonal, and residual components assuming an additive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result object provides access to the trend and seasonal series as arrays. It also provides access to the residuals, which are the time series after the trend, and seasonal components are removed. Finally, the original or observed data is also stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n",
    "series = ...\n",
    "result = seasonal_decompose(series, model='additive')\n",
    "print(result.trend)\n",
    "print(result.seasonal)\n",
    "print(result.resid)\n",
    "print(result.observed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These four time series can be plotted directly from the result object by calling the plot() function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot\n",
    "series = ...\n",
    "result = seasonal_decompose(series, model='additive')\n",
    "result.plot()\n",
    "```\n",
