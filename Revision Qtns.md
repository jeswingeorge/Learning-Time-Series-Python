# 8. General forcating models
### ACF and PACF plots

1. Difference between ACF and PACF plots.
	- Definition
	- x-axis and y-axis values and their calculation
	- formulas
	- `lag_plot()` function
2. Difference you can infer about stationary and non-stationary data using ACF.
3. What is shaded region in ACF plot?


### AR
1. What is autoregression? General Eqn? AR(1) and AR(2) eqns?
2. If p is high, we will incorporate more historical data but complexity will be very high.

### Descriptive stats for time series
1. Augmented dickey fueller test - H0 and H1
2. Granger Causality Test
3. AIC/BIC
4. Seasonality plots (General forecasting models: Descriptive stats part 3: 4:08)
	- Function to plot Seasonality with Month and Quarter Plots - notebook

### ARIMA
1.3 components of ARIMA: AR, I and MA.
2. p,d,q - obtaining it from the acf and PACF plots.
