## ACF and PACF plots

1. Difference between ACF and PACF plots.
	- Definition
	- x-axis and y-axis values and their calculation
	- formulas
	- `lag_plot()` function
2. Difference you can infer about stationary and non-stationary data using ACF.
3. What is shaded region in ACF plot?


## AR
1. What is autoregression? General Eqn? AR(1) and AR(2) eqns?
2. If p is high, we will incorporate more historical data but complexity will be very high.
